Welcome to Snap Adventure! This is a fanmade single-player experience designed to test the skill of veteran Marvel Snap players. This client works in tandem with the base game in order to create a uniquely challenging experience that tests a player's ability to work with limited resources and adapt their strategy to the situation. This adventure is designed to be a more long-form means of playing Marvel Snap, where a single full adventure could take 8-12 hours to complete. It is recommended to play this mode after being at least series 3 complete, though you can customize the database based on your collection.

In Snap Adventure, you are the commander of a team of superpowered individuals that have united against a common adversary. A diabolical mastermind has emerged from the shadows in search of the Infinity Stones, and it is up to you to stop this villain from obtaining them and destroying the multiverse. To make matters worse, the enemy has unleashed a powerful brainwashing toxin into the atmosphere that has converted nearly all civilian and superpowered beings to their side. Only your team possesses an antidote that grants them immunity from the toxin. The mastermind has also obtained the DNA of every member of your team, allowing them to turn your own strength against you. Your only hope is to journey across the eight worlds where the mastermind has set up bases and defeat the mastermind's seven generals. Then you can confront the mastermind directly and uncover its true identity.

4. Select one of the three profiles for saving purposes.
5. Set your starting cards and captains.

Gameplay
--------
1. Snap Adventure uses Marvel Snap's normal ranked play for the primary gameplay loop. It is recommended to reach Infinity before starting a new adventure, to avoid losing rank due to the potential difficulty of the campaign.
2. Players start with a limited team of cards, as well as a handful of cards labeled as captains. Your captains are the primary leaders of your team. If all of your captains are eliminated, captured, or sent away, you lose the adventure immediately. Your other lose condition is not having enough valid cards on your team to make a deck.
3. To start the adventure, click the glowing location at the bottom of the screen. This will bring up the first "section". Each world has four sections, as well as a boss section. Depending on the difficulty, you must complete a number of sections to reveal the boss. 2 for easy, 3 for normal, and all 4 for hard.
4. Before you can challenge a section, you must complete the section task listed in the top right of the section view. Most of these tasks require you to 'station' one of your cards in the section. Stationing cards removes them from your team for the remainder of the world in exchange for letting you challenge the location. At any time, you may unstation a card, but you have to immediately replace it with another card that meets the condition. If the section asks for a specific random card like with Ego, you may not swap it out since the cards chosen are the only valid ones.
5. If you do not wish to challenge the current section, you may skip the current section and advance to the next. This will pass the section without completing it, meaning it will not make progress toward revealing the boss. However, if you are on easy or normal difficulty, you do not have to complete all of the sections, so skipping can be a valuable tool.
6. Each section contains an enemy. Most normal sections are guarded by faceless mooks with no special abilities. All enemies have HP. In order to clear the section, you must reduce the enemy's HP to 0 or less. HP is reduced by winning battles in Marvel Snap, similar to Conquest mode.
7. 6 random sections throughout the adventure contain Infinity Stones as rewards for clearing them. When one appears in the rewards box, you must add the corresponding Infinity Stone as a secondary effect by right-clicking the enemy icon and choosing "Add Secondary Effect". Then select the corresponding Infinity Stone. Infinity Stones make the section harder, but collecting them grants you a powerful tool that will help you for the rest of the adventure. There is also a surprise waiting for those who manage to clear the adventure with all 6 Infinity Stones.
8.Use the Create Deck button to construct a deck using your current team. You may only use cards in the Deck Construction window. Clicking the confirm button will automatically paste the deck to your clipboard, allowing you to paste it into Marvel Snap. Leave the Match Result dialog open, and play a random ladder match with your team. Select the result in the dialog that matches the result of your match after it finishes, as well as whether you wish to perform a Captain Capture (see below).
9. If you win the match, deal 2 damage to the enemy. If the enemy retreated, deal 1 damage. If you snapped, double the damage dealt. The enemy snapping is irrelevant to damage calculation.
10. If you lose the match, a random card on your field will receive a wound. If you do not have at least one card in each location, extend the wound targets to include your hand. You can click the dice button to generate a random card. Reroll if the card is not on your field. Only cards in your starting deck can be wounded. To wound a card, right-click on the card from the main adventure screen and select "wound". Wounded cards may still be used, 
11. If your retreat from the match, you must choose a card in your hand or field. That card will be "captured". Captured cards are removed from your team for the remainder of the world, similar to stationed cards.
